# S3-Lambda-and-DynamoDB-Event-driven-architecture
### For this project, we will use the cloud formation template to create an S3 bucket, a lambda function, a Dynamo DB table, and an IAM role.Â 

### The project's goal is to capture and save the metadata of any object uploaded into a specific S3 bucket. We create an S3 notification that triggers the lambda function, which saves the object metadata into a Dynamo DB table.
